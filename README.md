Colabs for binary classification of images as graphene flakes or not graphene flakes. Pressing run all for either of the Colabs in the root directory trains a given set of pretrained models to identify graphene flakes in microscope images and tests the models on a given image of a graphene flake omitted from the train and test sets. Additionally, here is a link to a Medium article detailing the math behind training AlexNet to identify graphene flakes. https://medium.com/@56sarager/alexnet-and-the-binary-classification-of-graphene-ad07dc595867 Finally, also in the root directory, there is a pdf version of a slide presentation detailing the reproducible work found in this repository as well as the motivation for the project. Note the Supplemental Material folder is provided in the name of completeness. It simply contains the files used for data cleaning and generating plots for the presentation.
