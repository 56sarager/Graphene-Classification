Colabs for binary classification of images as graphene flakes or not graphene flakes. Pressing run all for either of the files in the repository trains a given set of pretrained models to identify graphene flakes in microscope images and tests the models on a given image of a graphene flake omitted from the train and test sets. Additionally, here is a link to a Medium article detailing the math behind training AlexNet to identify graphene flakes. https://medium.com/@56sarager/alexnet-and-the-binary-classification-of-graphene-ad07dc595867 Finally, also in the root directory, there is a pdf version of a slide presentation detailing the reproducible work found in this repository as well as the motivation for the project.
